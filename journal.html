<h1>tiger's journal.</h1>
<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 1: we learned how to use Sublime Text (which is what is being used to code this website) and I actually have a decent start. I will definitely have to change the images and text but it's something. The code that we're using has to go through github to put it into a website format, and there are a lot of terms that we just learned - "terminal" "repository" "html" etc. - that we'll use for the rest of the year. Pretty fun though</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 2: we turned the website into an actual website. It's kinda hard to explain, but basically I have to go into terminal and use "git" commands. Still confusing but it's making a bit more sense now. HOW TO PUSH:     1- cd ./desktop/TigerPatton-0.github.io     2- git status     3- git add .     4- git commit -m "what i did today"     5- git push</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 3: I made an animation with a square zooming in and out. It's simple but still fun. We also just started using javascript. We used it a bit last year but I don't remember much. We're starting to use commands that make it so clicking or pressing a key does an action (like moving an objext or changing colors).</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 4: I made a jumpscare for HALLOWEEN. It is a path/maze for your mouse and you have to drag it through the maze without hitting the red. It's pretty tough at first but it gets a bit easier as you do it. The code was kinda tough to put the path on top of the background because the z-index kept getting messed up and stuff, but it worked at the end.</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 5: I began a cookie clicker project. It's tough because I haven't figured out how to add a score counter but the clicking part is working. I want to make some automated stuff as well like an auto-cookie-gain thing like the real cookie clicker websites. I'm not gonna make it too detail-oriented but it will hopefully look good enough.</p>
