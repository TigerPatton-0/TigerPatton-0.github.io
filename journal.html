<h1>tiger's journal.</h1>
<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 1: We learned how to use Sublime Text (which is what is being used to code this website) and I actually have a decent start. I will definitely have to change the images and text but it's something. The code that we're using has to go through github to put it into a website format, and there are a lot of terms that we just learned - "terminal" "repository" "html" etc. - that we'll use for the rest of the year. Pretty fun though</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 2: We turned the website into an actual website. It's kinda hard to explain, but basically I have to go into terminal and use "git" commands. Still confusing but it's making a bit more sense now. HOW TO PUSH:     1- cd ./desktop/TigerPatton-0.github.io     2- git status     3- git add .     4- git commit -m "what i did today"     5- git push</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 3: I made an animation with a square zooming in and out. It's simple but still fun. We also just started using javascript. We used it a bit last year but I don't remember much. We're starting to use commands that make it so clicking or pressing a key does an action (like moving an objext or changing colors).</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 4: I made a jumpscare for HALLOWEEN. It is a path/maze for your mouse and you have to drag it through the maze without hitting the red. It's pretty tough at first but it gets a bit easier as you do it. The code was kinda tough to put the path on top of the background because the z-index kept getting messed up and stuff, but it worked at the end.</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 5: I began a cookie clicker project. It's tough because I haven't figured out how to add a score counter but the clicking part is working. I want to make some automated stuff as well like an auto-cookie-gain thing like the real cookie clicker websites. I'm not gonna make it too detail-oriented but it will hopefully look good enough.</p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 6: I made a holiday gift for my dad. When you hover over the ornaments it shows a message. Kinda annoying to get the text inside to position correctly but it looks alright. I guess I'm into the Christmas theme because I also began an ornament placer that worked at one point but now it's not working. Not sure what the problem is but I think it's with the position of the mouse (x,y) and putting the ornaments on the tree. </p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 7: Just made a random number generator. It's not very interesting. It's your spirit measurement. Pretty dull if I do say so myself. The code to make the random number makes sense but it's annoying to make the code for the random. It's something like math.floor and math.random. Pretty fun to use the random stuff anyways. </p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 8: Made an array of squares. If you click on it it turns another color. Stars red and goes to orange, then click again it goes to yellow, then green blue black. Not too tough to make but it was a bit repetitive because I had to make the same code for each color (like "click" function(); kinda annoying). It's fine. Looks cool. </p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 9: Made a car thing that can move when you hit the arrow keys, but it goes offscreen if you move it too far. Also started a valentines day gift that isn't finished yet. just a machine that dispenses messages and stuff. Kinda weird but aight. </p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 10: Made a valentine's gift for whoever wants to open the page. Not for anybody in particular. It's a big color-changing circle and it types out a message for the reader. I made the circle expand into a larger circle when a button is clicked and the message and color changes when you click. Also tweaked a few other projects. </p>

<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 11: Good progress on final project. It's a minigolf game where you drag back to aim and hit the ball and you gotta get it in the hole. I got the movement working but I need to add boundaries so it bounces off of the edge of the board / golf course. And also to make a winning animation or something like it. </p>
