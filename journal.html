<h1>tiger's journal.</h1>
<p>JOURNAL ENTRY 1: we learned how to use Sublime Text (which is what is being used to code this website) and I actually have a decent start. I will definitely have to change the images and text but it's something. The code that we're using has to go through github to put it into a website format, and there are a lot of terms that we just learned - "terminal" "repository" "html" etc. - that we'll use for the rest of the year. Pretty fun though</p>
